    **Create and initialize your project:**

    ```bash
    # Create new project from template
    nitric new my-first-app

    ```bash
    Welcome to Nitric, this command will help you create a project from a template.
    
    Project name: my-first-app
    
    ? Template: 
      > acme/api-starter - REST API template
        acme/web-app - Full-stack web application
        acme/microservice - Microservice template
    
    Template: acme/api-starter
    
    ✓ Project created!
    ```

    <Tip>
      Choose a template that matches your use case or preferred framework.

    ✓ Terraform generated successfully
      output written to ./.nitric/stacks/my-first-app-aws-12345
    
    Next steps:
    1. Run cd ./.nitric/stacks/my-first-app-aws-12345 to move to the stack directory
    2. Initialize the stack terraform init -upgrade
    3. Optionally, preview with terraform plan
    4. Deploy with terraform apply
    ```

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

    ```bash
    Terraform will perform the following actions:
    
      # aws_s3_bucket.storage will be created
      + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "storage" {
          + bucket = "my-first-app-storage"
          ...
      }
    
    Plan: 15 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```

    ```bash
