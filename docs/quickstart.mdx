    **Create and initialize your project:**

    ```bash
    # Create new project from template
    suga new my-first-app
    ```

    ```bash
    Welcome to Suga, this command will help you create a project from a template.
    
    Project name: my-first-app
    
    ? Template: 
      > acme/api-starter - REST API template
        acme/web-app - Full-stack web application
        acme/microservice - Microservice template
    
    Template: acme/api-starter
    
    ✓ Project created!
    ```

    <Tip>
      Choose a template that matches your use case or preferred framework.
    </Tip>
    ```bash
    cd my-first-app
    
    # Review the generated project structure
    ls -la
    ```

    Use the visual editor to choose from available targets:

    ```bash
    suga edit
    ```

    ![deploy targets.png](/images/deploy-targets.png)

    Or add deployment targets to `suga.yaml`:

    ```bash suga.yaml
    targets:
      - suga/aws@latest # or suga/gcp@latest, suga/azure@latest
    ```

    **Generate Terraform:**

    ```bash
    suga build
    ```

    ```bash
    ✓ Terraform generated successfully
      output written to ./.suga/stacks/my-first-app-aws-12345
    
    Next steps:
    1. Run cd ./.suga/stacks/my-first-app-aws-12345 to move to the stack directory
    2. Initialize the stack terraform init -upgrade
    3. Optionally, preview with terraform plan
    4. Deploy with terraform apply
    ```

    **Setup cloud credentials:**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AWS">
        ```bash
        # AWS
        aws configure
        ```

    </Tabs>
    **Deploy with Terraform:**

    ```bash
    cd .suga/stacks/my-first-app-aws-xyz
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

    ```bash
    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

    ```bash
    Terraform will perform the following actions:
    
      # aws_s3_bucket.storage will be created
      + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "storage" {
          + bucket = "my-first-app-storage"
          ...
      }
    
    Plan: 15 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    ```bash
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
    
      Enter a value: yes
    
    Apply complete! Resources: 15 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    
    Outputs:
    api_endpoint = "https://api.my-first-app.example.com"
