    **Create and initialize your project:**

    Create a new project from a template using the following command:

    ```bash
    suga new my-first-app
    ```

    You'll be prompted to select a template that matches your use case:

    ```bash
    Welcome to Suga, this command will help you create a project from a template.
    
    Project name: my-first-app
    
    ? Template: 
      > acme/api-starter - REST API template
        acme/web-app - Full-stack web application
        acme/microservice - Microservice template
    
    Template: acme/api-starter
    
    ✓ Project created!
    ```

    <Tip>
      Choose a template that matches your use case or preferred framework.
    </Tip>
    Navigate to your new project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-first-app
    ```

    Review the generated project structure:

    ```bash
    ls -la
    ```

    Your project will have the following structure:

    ```bash
    my-first-app/
    ├── suga.yaml          # Project configuration
    ├── package.json       # Dependencies (Node.js)
    ├── services/
    │    └── api.ts        # Your API service code
    └── README.md          # Project documentation
    ```

    Install the project dependencies based on your language:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Node.js">
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Python">
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    **Configure or review your application architecture:**

    First, log in to the Suga platform:

    ```bash
    suga login
    ```

    You'll see a confirmation message:

    ```bash
    ⚡ Suga Logging in...
    
    ✓ Logged in as User
    ```

    Open the visual editor to review and modify your application architecture:

    ```bash
    suga edit
    ```

    The editor will launch in your browser:

    ```bash
    ⚡ Suga Editor
    Opening visual editor at http://localhost:3001
    Press Ctrl+C to stop the editor
    ```

  <Accordion title="Step 3: Develop" icon="code">
    **Run your application locally:**

    Start the development server with hot reload enabled:

    ```bash
    suga dev
    ```

    The development server will start and display connection information:

    ```bash
    ⚡ Suga v1.0.0
       - App: my-first-app
       - Addr: http://localhost:50051
       - Dashboard: https://app.addsuga.com/dev
    
    Services
    
    ✓ Starting [api]
    
    Entrypoints
    
    ✓ Starting [main] http://localhost:3000
    
    Use Ctrl-C to exit
    ```

    <Tip>
      Services automatically restart when you update your application code
    </Tip>
    **Test your application**

    Send a test request to verify your application is running:

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:3000/hello
    ```

    Expected response:

    ```json
    {"message": "Hello World"}
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 4: Deploy" icon="cloud">
    **Configure deployment target and deploy to production:**

    Use the visual editor to choose from available deployment targets:

    ```bash
    suga edit
    ```

    ![deploy targets.png](/images/deploy-targets.png)

    Alternatively, you can manually add deployment targets to your `suga.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    targets:
      - suga/aws@latest
      - suga/gcp@latest
      - suga/azure@latest
    ```

    **Generate Terraform:**

    Build the Terraform configuration for your chosen deployment target:

    ```bash
    suga build
    ```

    The build process will generate infrastructure code:

    ```bash
    ✓ Terraform generated successfully
      output written to ./.suga/stacks/my-first-app-aws-12345
    
    Next steps:
    1. Run cd ./.suga/stacks/my-first-app-aws-12345 to move to the stack directory
    2. Initialize the stack terraform init -upgrade
    3. Optionally, preview with terraform plan
    4. Deploy with terraform apply
    ```

    **Setup cloud credentials:**

    Configure credentials for your chosen cloud provider:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="AWS">
        ```bash
        aws configure
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="GCP">
        ```bash
        gcloud auth application-default login
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Azure">
        ```bash
        az login
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    **Deploy with Terraform:**

    Navigate to the generated stack directory:

    ```bash
    cd .suga/stacks/my-first-app-aws-xyz
    ```

    Initialize Terraform:

    ```bash
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

    You'll see a success message:

    ```bash
    Terraform has been successfully initialized!
    ```

    Preview the changes Terraform will make:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

    Review the planned infrastructure changes:

    ```bash
    Terraform will perform the following actions:
    
      # aws_s3_bucket.storage will be created
      + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "storage" {
          + bucket = "my-first-app-storage"
          ...
      }
    
    Plan: 15 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
    ```

    Apply the Terraform configuration to deploy your application:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    Confirm the deployment when prompted:

    ```bash
    Do you want to perform these actions?
      Terraform will perform the actions described above.
      Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
    
      Enter a value: yes
    
    Apply complete! Resources: 15 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
    
    Outputs:
    api_endpoint = "https://api.my-first-app.example.com"
    ```
