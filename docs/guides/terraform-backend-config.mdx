description: 'Configure remote state management for Terraform stacks generated with Suga'
---

## Overview

Suga uses [CDKTF](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf) (Cloud Development Kit for Terraform) to generate Terraform configurations. By default, the generated stacks use local [state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state) files. For production environments and team collaboration, you'll want to configure a remote backend to store your Terraform state securely and enable state locking.

This guide covers how to add backend configuration to your Suga-generated Terraform stacks for common backend providers.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring a backend:

1. **Generate your Terraform stack** using `suga build` (this runs CDKTF synthesis)
2. **Choose a backend provider** (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, Terraform Cloud, etc.)
3. **Create the backend storage resources** (bucket, storage account, workspace, etc.)
4. **Ensure proper permissions** are configured for accessing the backend

## Understanding Suga's CDKTF Output

When you run `suga build`, CDKTF synthesizes your infrastructure into standard Terraform JSON configuration files:

```
terraform/
└── stacks/
    └── <stack_name>/
        ├── cdk.tf.json      # Main configuration
        └── ...
```

The synthesized output can be found in the `terraform` directory.

## Adding Backend Configuration

After running `suga build`, add a backend configuration file to the synthesized output:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate the Stack">
    ```bash
    suga build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Backend Configuration">
    Create `backend.tf` in the synthesized stack directory:
    
    ```bash
    touch terraform/stacks/<stack_name>/backend.tf
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Backend Configuration">
    Add your configuration.
    See terraform docs on [backend configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize and Deploy">
    ```bash
    cd terraform/stacks/<stack_name>
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Only the cdktf files are managed by Suga. You can safely add custom `.tf` files to the stack directory to extend the configuration.
</Note>

## Managing state for Multiple Environments

For managing multiple environments we recommend using Terraform workspaces.

For documentation on best practices for managing multiple environments with terraform see the [official docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces).
