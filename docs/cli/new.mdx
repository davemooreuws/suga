Create a new Suga project from a template.

```bash
suga new [project-name]
```

Use this command when you want to **create a new project from scratch** using Suga. This command sets up a complete new application with both application code and infrastructure configuration based on a template.

The command creates a new directory with your project name, including:
- Application code (Python, TypeScript, Go, etc.)
- Suga configuration (`suga.yaml`)
- Dockerfile and other necessary files
- Example infrastructure setup

## When to use `suga new`

- You're starting a completely new project
- You want to use a pre-built template with best practices
- You prefer to have the application code and infrastructure set up together

## Options

- `-f, --force` - Force overwrite existing project directory

## Examples

```bash
# Create project with default template
suga new my-app

# Force overwrite existing directory
suga new my-app --force
```

## Alternative

If you **already have an existing application** and want to add Suga infrastructure management to it, use [`suga init`](/cli/init) instead.
