Login to the Suga CLI.

```bash
suga login
```

Opens your browser to complete the authentication flow with the Suga platform. This is required for all CLI operations during the early access period.

## What happens during login

1. Opens your default web browser
2. Redirects you to the Suga authentication page
3. After successful authentication, returns you to the CLI
4. Stores your authentication credentials locally

## Example

```bash
suga login
```

<Note>
  You'll need to login before using most Suga CLI commands. Your session will remain active until you explicitly logout or the session expires.
