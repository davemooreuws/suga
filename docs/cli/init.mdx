Setup a new Suga project, including within existing applications.

```bash
suga init
```

Use this command when you **already have an existing application** (e.g., a Python Flask app, TypeScript Express server, or any other web application) and want to start using Suga to create and deploy the infrastructure for that app.

This creates the necessary Suga configuration files (`suga.yaml`) to transform your existing application into a Suga project, allowing you to define and manage cloud infrastructure alongside your code.

## When to use `suga init`

- You have an existing Python, TypeScript, Go, or other application
- You want to add Suga infrastructure management to your current project
- You prefer to keep your existing project structure and dependencies

## Alternative

If you want to create a **new project from scratch** using Suga templates, use [`suga new`](/cli/new) instead.
