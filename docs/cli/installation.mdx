## Install Suga CLI

The Suga CLI is all you need to get started with Suga. It provides everything required to build, test, and deploy cloud-native applications with automatic infrastructure generation.

<Note>
  **Early Access:** During the early access period, a Suga account is required for all CLI operations. You'll need to run `suga login` after installation to authenticate. We plan to make certain functionality available without an account in future releases.
</Note>

## Web UI

The Suga platform includes a web-based visual editor for designing your application architecture. **No separate installation is required** - simply visit [app.addsuga.com](https://app.addsuga.com) in your browser.

The web UI provides:
- Visual infrastructure design
- AI-assisted architecture recommendations  
- Team collaboration features
- Deployment target configuration

Access it through the CLI:

```bash
suga edit
```

This opens the visual editor in your browser and connects it to your local CLI, with the full platform features available at [app.addsuga.com](https://app.addsuga.com).
