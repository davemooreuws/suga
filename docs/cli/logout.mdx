Logout from the Suga CLI.

```bash
suga logout
```

Clears your local authentication session and revokes stored credentials. After logging out, you'll need to run `suga login` again to use CLI commands that require authentication.

## What happens during logout

1. Revokes your current authentication session
2. Clears locally stored credentials
3. Requires re-authentication for future CLI operations

## Example

```bash
suga logout
```

<Note>
  After logging out, most CLI commands will require you to login again using `suga login`.
