Switch between teams or list available teams.

When run without arguments, displays an interactive list of available teams.

```bash
suga team
```

When run with a team slug, switches directly to that team.

```bash
suga team my-team
```

## Example

Showing the interactive team switcher:

```bash
suga team

Current team: My Other Team

Select a team:
➜ My Team
  My Other Team (current)
```

Switching directly using the team slug:

```bash
suga team my-team

Current team: My Other Team

Switching to team: My Team
✓ Successfully switched to team: My Team
```
