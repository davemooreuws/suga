description: 'Builds the Suga application'
---

Builds an application using the suga.yaml application spec and referenced platform.

```bash
suga build
```

The build command transforms your Suga application configuration into production-ready Terraform infrastructure code. This is typically the step you run before deploying to cloud providers.

## What happens during build

1. **Validates configuration** - Checks your `suga.yaml` for errors
2. **Analyzes dependencies** - Reviews your application services and resources
3. **Generates Terraform** - Creates cloud provider-specific infrastructure code
4. **Outputs deployment stack** - Produces a complete Terraform directory ready for deployment

## Output Structure

The build process creates a `.suga/stacks/` directory containing:
- **Terraform configuration** - Cloud provider resources (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Application containers** - Services, built into Docker Containers ready for deployment  
- **Networking setup** - Load balancers, security groups, routing
- **Resource definitions** - Databases, storage buckets, queues, etc.

## Next Steps After Build

1. Navigate to the generated stack directory: `cd .suga/stacks/your-app-{provider}-{id}`
2. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init -upgrade`
3. Preview changes: `terraform plan`
4. Deploy: `terraform apply`

## Example

```bash
suga build
```

The command will prompt you to select your deployment target (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and region if not already configured.
