## Contributions

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Suga project. If you want specifics about contributing to the documentation or the Suga repo, take a look at the [development guide](./DEVELOPERS.md).

There are plenty of ways to get involved, we've summarized a few here to get you started.

Our team encourages you to ask questions, raise requests for new features and let us know about bugs!

### Submit a feature request or bug report

You can ask questions and launch discussions about Suga-related topics in the suga repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/nitrictech/suga/issues/new).

### Issues and smaller features

Issues marked as 'good-first-issue' are a great place to start, but feel free to take on any issue you'd like. We'd love it if you found a bug and wanted to fix it yourself. Create a bug issue describing the problem you've found and create a pull request.

### New Feature Work

Newer and larger issues which you're interested in will probably require a discussion. Submit a new feature request (as per above), we're quick to respond and will get the conversation flowing. Take a few minutes to make sure that the issue is unique, or link any issues which are relevant to help our maintainers.
